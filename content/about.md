ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Crumblearn, a platform dedicated to providing open-educational resources in the fields of computational chemistry and biology.
Our mission is to break down the barriers to knowledge and make high-quality educational content accessible to anyone with a passion for learning.

<br>

Just like a trail of breadcrumbs guides you through a forest, Crumblearn guides you through computer-aided drug design, discrete mathematics, genomics, supervised learning, and many more topics that form the foundation of computational chemistry and biology.
We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to explore these subjects, regardless of their background or access to traditional higher education.

<br>

On this website, you will find links to a wealth of resources, including articles, tutorials, interactive simulations, and problem sets, all designed to help you grasp complex concepts and develop practical skills.
Whether you're a curious beginner or an advanced learner looking to deepen your understanding, Crumblearn has something for you.
